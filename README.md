# Welcome to my portfolio

## About me

I'm a Goulven CLEC'H, a 22 yo web developer & designer, self-taught, based in Toulouse, France. I love to design and develop websites that are easy to navigate, fun to look at and blasting fast!

I specialize myself in the Javascript ecosystem, and I'm particularly interested in VueJS and his frameworks and PWA generators, like Nuxt and Gridsome. I am familiar with Git, webpack, NPM and a lot of organization tools (Github Projects, Trello, etc). I adapt easily to different work environments and I'm constantly looking for new challenges!

## About my portfolio

This site is powered by Gridsome, a VueJS site generator, and hosted by Netlify. I also used Tailwind and FontAwesome. Feel free to take inspiration on the code or take some bits for your own website :)
