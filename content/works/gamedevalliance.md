Following the closure of our forum, we needed a landing page to announce our different gamejams and showcasing our latest videos. It will be soon replaced by [Game Dev Alliance (next)](/work/gamedevalliance-next) !

Designated on Figma, it is a simple static site in HTML5 and CSS3. The two strong points of the design are the mascots on the top, and the animated background gradient. The site is perfectly responsive, very light, and redirects to all our content and our social networks.
