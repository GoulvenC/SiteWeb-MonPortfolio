                <p>Self-taught, based in Toulouse, France. I love to design and develop websites that are easy to navigate, fun to look at and blasting fast!</p>
                <p>I specialize myself in the Javascript ecosystem, and am particularly interested in VueJS and his frameworks and PWA generators, like Nuxt and Gridsome. I am familiar with Git, webpack, NPM and a lot of organisations tools (Github Project, Trello, etc). I adapt easily to different work environments and am constantly looking for new challenges!</p>
